This is release 0.2.x which is a restart after years.
I start with updating the technic behind the scene.
Introduce ChromeLogger for replacing outdated FirePHP,
use composer/packagist, start using PHP 7.2 features.
For all this I switched to 0.2.0 numbering.

/**
* cleans up the caching configuration and adds clear
* caching. Also the DataHandler can now use the caching system. 
* How you can see in the demo application most things should now on the shape of
* pre-alpha quality. So it would be possible to play with it in small applications.
* This is also demonstrated in the ForwardDemo package.
* As the caching system is now ready to use and the DataHandler can use it, the next
* part is to implement base object and data mapper.
* So we are getting closer to the release of 0.1.0. But there will be a 0.0.11 and
* maybe a 0.0.12 release before.
