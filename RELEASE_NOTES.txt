This is release 0.0.10 which cleans up the caching configuration and adds clear
caching. Also the DataHandler can now use the caching system. 
How you can see in the demo application most things should now on the shape of
pre-alpha quality. So it would be possible to play with it in small applications.
This is also demonstrated in the ForwardDemo package.
As the caching system is now ready to use and the DataHandler can use it, the next
part is to implement base object and data mapper.
So we are getting closer to the release of 0.1.0. But there will be a 0.0.11 and
maybe a 0.0.12 release before.

Requirements:

- PHP 5.2.6 or newer

- You'll need the FirePHPCore extension, which you can find on http://www.firephp.org.
