This is the seventh runable Release, which won't help you much but will demonstrate
the technics behind this project.
How you can see in the demo application most things should now on the shape of pre-alpha quality.
So it would be possible to play with it in small applications. Which is also demonstrated in
the ForwardDemo package.
After the possibility of multiple screens and views now the DataHandler is introduced. As there
are no basic objects or any object mapper. You can't do any real object oriented thing.
The next release will bring a caching framework. Yes I know there are much caching FW out but
nothing that suites my thoughts (cache looking, old cache data on loading problem).

Requirements:

- PHP 5.2.6 or newer

- You'll need the FirePHPCore extension, which you can find on http://www.firephp.org.

- You can use Smarty Template Engine (Version 2 or 3), which you can find on
http://www.smarty.net or the Twig Template Engine (0.9.6 or newer), which you can
find on http://www.twig-project.org.
