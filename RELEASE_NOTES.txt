This is release 0.0.9 which finalize parts of the Caching System and is now ready
to be used, but needs a clean up on the configuration part.
How you can see in the demo application most things should now on the shape of
pre-alpha quality. So it would be possible to play with it in small applications.
This is also demonstrated in the ForwardDemo package.
As the Caching System is now useable as it should be (Cache Looking, usage of 
Exceptions) the next things to do are cleaning configuration of Caching System,
use Caching System inside DataLoader, implement base object and data mapper.
So we are getting closer to the release of 0.1.0. But there will be a 0.0.10 and
maybe a 0.0.11 release before.
