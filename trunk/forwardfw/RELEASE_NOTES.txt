This is the eighth runable Release, which won't help you much but will demonstrate
the technics behind this project.
How you can see in the demo application most things should now on the shape of pre-alpha quality.
So it would be possible to play with it in small applications. Which is also demonstrated in
the ForwardDemo package.
After the possibilities of the DataHandler now the caching framework is introduced. As the
Exceptions aren't there yet, it isn't so useful as it will be. Also the looking mechanismus
isn't there yet, but will be in the next release. So we are getting closer to the release
of 0.1.0. But it may be, that I'll release 0.0.10 after 0.9.0.

Requirements:

- PHP 5.2.6 or newer

- You'll need the FirePHPCore extension, which you can find on http://www.firephp.org.

- You can use Smarty Template Engine (Version 2 or 3), which you can find on
http://www.smarty.net or the Twig Template Engine (0.9.6 or newer), which you can
find on http://www.twig-project.org.
